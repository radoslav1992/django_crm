# Email Functionality Guide

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### üìß **Invoice & Offer Email Sending**

Your Django CRM now has complete email functionality for invoices and offers!

## üéØ What Was Added

### 1. **Email Tracking Fields**
Both Invoice and Offer models now track:
- `email_sent` - Whether the email has been sent
- `email_sent_at` - Timestamp of when the email was sent

### 2. **Email Sending Methods**
- `invoice.send_email(request)` - Sends invoice email to client
- `offer.send_email(request)` - Sends offer email to client

### 3. **Email Templates**
Beautiful HTML email templates:
- `templates/invoices/email_invoice.html` - Invoice email template
- `templates/invoices/email_offer.html` - Offer email template

Both templates include:
- Professional design with your branding
- Document details (number, date, total amount)
- Link to view/download PDF
- Payment link button (for invoices with Stripe payment URL)
- Responsive design

### 4. **UI Integration**
- **Send Email Button** on invoice and offer detail pages
- **Email Status Badge** showing when email was sent
- **Disabled state** if client email is missing
- **Confirmation dialog** before sending
